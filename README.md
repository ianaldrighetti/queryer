Queryer is a simple PHP database abstraction layer. It isn't meant to be anything fancy or all encompassing, but I
intend to use it in many of my projects.

There is no official release yet. I was planning on doing a v1.0 release but I have since changed quite a bit and will wait on finishing that first.

Queryer is released under the MS-RL license. You can find the full license in the LICENSE.md file.

## Database Support

Queryer currently only supports MySQL, though it can be extended to support other database systems.

## Documentation

You can see all the documentation for Queryer within our [Wiki](https://github.com/ianaldrighetti/queryer/wiki).
