# Queryer

Queryer is a simple PHP database abstraction layer. It isn't meant to be anything fancy or all encompassing, but I
intend to use it in many of my projects.

Queryer is released under the MS-RL license. You can find the full license in the LICENSE.md file.

## Database Support

Queryer currently only supports MySQL, though it can be extended to support other database systems.
